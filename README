a binary that executes 2 instructions in userspace before execing itself and starting over

sudo sysctl vm.mmap_min_addr=0
make
strace ./x


execve(NULL, NULL, NULL)                = 0
execve(NULL, NULL, NULL)                = 0
execve(NULL, NULL, NULL)                = 0
execve(NULL, NULL, NULL)                = 0
execve(NULL, NULL, NULL)                = 0
(all succeeding)
bet you've bever seen such a strace before!
